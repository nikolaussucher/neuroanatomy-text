<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.0.1</span> Parkinson’s disease</h3>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. It typically manifests as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and posture instability. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries.</p>
<p>PD is primarily characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. The cause of this selective cell death is unknown. Notably, alpha-synuclein-ubiquitin complexes and aggregates are observed to accumulate in Lewy bodies within affected neurons. It is thought that defects in protein transport machinery and regulation, such as RAB1, may play a role in this disease mechanism. Impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein may also lead to its accumulation in Lewy bodies. Experiments have revealed reduced transport rates of both wild-type and two familial Parkinson’s disease-associated mutant alpha-synucleins through axons of cultured neurons. Membrane damage by alpha-synuclein could be another Parkinson’s disease mechanism.</p>

<p>The main known risk factor is age. Mutations in genes such as α-synuclein (SNCA), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), glucocerebrosidase (GBA), and tau protein (MAPT) can also cause hereditary PD or increase PD risk.</p>

<div id="huntingtons-disease" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.0.2</span> Huntington’s disease</h3>
<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the huntingtin gene. HD is characterized by loss of medium spiny neurons and astrogliosis. The first brain region to be substantially affected is the striatum, followed by degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices. The striatum’s subthalamic nuclei send control signals to the globus pallidus, which initiates and modulates motion. The weaker signals from subthalamic nuclei thus cause reduced initiation and modulation of movement, resulting in the characteristic movements of the disorder, notably chorea.</p>
<p>HD is caused by polyglutamine tract expansion in the huntingtin gene, resulting in the aggregation-prone mutant huntingtin (mHtt). mHtt aggregates may be directly toxic. Additionally, they may damage molecular motors and microtubules to interfere with normal axonal transport, leading to impaired transport of important cargoes such as BDNF.</p>
</div>
<div id="amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.0.3</span> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</h3>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease) is a disease in which motor neurons are selectively targeted for degeneration. In 1993, missense mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were discovered in a subsets of patients with familial ALS. This discovery led researchers to focus on unlocking the mechanisms for SOD1-mediated diseases. However, the pathogenic mechanism underlying SOD1 mutant toxicity has yet to be resolved. More recently, TDP-43 and FUS protein aggregates have been implicated in some cases of the disease, and a mutation in chromosome 9 (C9orf72) is thought to be the most common known cause of sporadic ALS.</p>
<p>Recent independent research by Nagai et al. and Di Giorgio et al. provide in vitro evidence that the primary cellular sites where SOD1 mutations act are located on astrocytes. Astrocytes then cause the toxic effects on the motor neurons. The specific mechanism of toxicity still needs to be investigated, but the findings are significant because they implicate cells other than neuron cells in neurodegeneration.</p>

<div id="cerebrovascular-disease" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Cerebrovascular Disease</h2>
<p>Cerebrovascular disease includes a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation. Arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain are often damaged or deformed in these disorders. The most common presentation of cerebrovascular disease is an ischemic stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes a hemorrhagic stroke. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the most important contributing risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular diseases as it can change the structure of blood vessels and result in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased cerebral perfusion. Other risk factors that contribute to stroke include smoking and diabetes. Narrowed cerebral arteries can lead to ischemic stroke, but continually elevated blood pressure can also cause tearing of vessels, leading to a hemorrhagic stroke.</p>
<div id="stroke" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.1.1</span> Stroke</h3>
<p>A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain’s membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan. A CT scan can rule out bleeding, but may not necessarily rule out ischemia, which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms.</p>
<p>Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing, and warfarin in people with atrial fibrillation. Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery. Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation, and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world.</p>
<p>In 2013, approximately 6.9 million people had an ischemic stroke and 3.4 million people had a hemorrhagic stroke. In 2015, there were about 42.4 million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3 million deaths (11% of the total). About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke. About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year. Overall, two thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old.</p>
<p>Strokes can be classified into two major categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes are caused by interruption of the blood supply to the brain, while hemorrhagic strokes result from the rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure. About 87% of strokes are ischemic, the rest being hemorrhagic. Bleeding can develop inside areas of ischemia, a condition known as “hemorrhagic transformation.” It is unknown how many hemorrhagic strokes actually start as ischemic strokes.</p>
<p>In the 1970s the World Health Organization defined stroke as a “neurological deficit of cerebrovascular cause that persists beyond 24 hours or is interrupted by death within 24 hours”, although the word “stroke” is centuries old. This definition was supposed to reflect the reversibility of tissue damage and was devised for the purpose, with the time frame of 24 hours being chosen arbitrarily. The 24-hour limit divides stroke from transient ischemic attack, which is a related syndrome of stroke symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours. With the availability of treatments that can reduce stroke severity when given early, many now prefer alternative terminology, such as brain attack and acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (modeled after heart attack and acute coronary syndrome, respectively), to reflect the urgency of stroke symptoms and the need to act swiftly.</p>
<p>In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. There are four reasons why this might happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thrombosis (obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot forming locally)</li>
<li>Embolism (obstruction due to an embolus from elsewhere in the body),</li>
<li>Systemic hypoperfusion (general decrease in blood supply, e.g., in shock)</li>
<li>Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various classification systems for acute ischemic stroke. The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms; based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), lacunar infarct (LACI) or posterior circulation infarct (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain that is affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis. The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, a stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery, (2) an embolism originating in the heart, (3) complete blockage of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation). Users of stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine are at a high risk for ischemic strokes.</p>
<p>There are two main types of hemorrhagic stroke:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intracerebral hemorrhage, which is basically bleeding within the brain itself (when an artery in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood), due to either intraparenchymal hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain tissue) or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain’s ventricular system).</li>
<li>Subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is basically bleeding that occurs outside of the brain tissue but still within the skull, and precisely between the arachnoid mater and pia mater (the delicate innermost layer of the three layers of the meninges that surround the brain).</li>
</ul>
<p>The above two main types of hemorrhagic stroke are also two different forms of intracranial hemorrhage, which is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the cranial vault; but the other forms of intracranial hemorrhage, such as epidural hematoma (bleeding between the skull and the dura mater, which is the thick outermost layer of the meninges that surround the brain) and subdural hematoma (bleeding in the subdural space), are not considered “hemorrhagic strokes”.</p>
<p>Hemorrhagic strokes may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage.[citation needed]</p>
<p>In addition to neurological impairment, hemorrhagic strokes usually cause specific symptoms (for instance, subarachnoid hemorrhage classically causes a severe headache known as a thunderclap headache) or reveal evidence of a previous head injury.</p>
<p>Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly, over seconds to minutes, and in most cases do not progress further. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. The more extensive the area of the brain affected, the more functions that are likely to be lost. Some forms of stroke can cause additional symptoms. For example, in intracranial hemorrhage, the affected area may compress other structures. Most forms of stroke are not associated with a headache, apart from subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage.[citation needed]</p>

<div id="epilepsy" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> Epilepsy</h2>
<p>Epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries, including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures have a tendency to recur and, as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of the world and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to their condition.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The underlying mechanism of epileptic seizures is excessive and abnormal neuronal activity in the cortex of the brain. The reason this occurs in most cases of epilepsy is unknown. Some cases occur as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, or birth defects through a process known as epileptogenesis. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms, such as fainting, and determining if another cause of seizures is present, such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition.</p>
<p>Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases; inexpensive anti-seizure medications are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, surgery, neurostimulation or dietary changes may then be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.</p>
<p>As of 2015, about 39 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2015, it resulted in 125,000 deaths, an increase from 112,000 in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the elderly. In the developing world, onset is more common in older children and young adults due to differences in the frequency of the underlying causes. About 5–10% of people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80, and the chance of experiencing a second seizure is between 40% and 50%. In many areas of the world, those with epilepsy either have restrictions placed on their ability to drive or are not permitted to drive until they are free of seizures for a specific length of time. The word epilepsy is from Ancient Greek ἐπιλαμβάνειν, ‘to seize, possess, or afflict’.</p>
<p>Normally brain electrical activity is non-synchronous, as neurons do not normally fire in sync with each other, but rather fire in order as signals travel throughout the brain. Its activity is regulated by various factors both within the neuron and the cellular environment. Factors within the neuron include the type, number and distribution of ion channels, changes to receptors and changes of gene expression. Factors around the neuron include ion concentrations, synaptic plasticity and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells. Chronic inflammation also appears to play a role.</p>
<p>The exact mechanism of epilepsy is unknown, but a little is known about its cellular and network mechanisms. However, it is unknown under which circumstances the brain shifts into the activity of a seizure with its excessive synchronization.</p>
<p>In epilepsy, the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased. This may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly. This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a “seizure focus”. Another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up-regulation of excitatory circuits or down-regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain. These secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis. Failure of the blood–brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism as it would allow substances in the blood to enter the brain.</p>
<p>There is evidence that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, flickering light, or a lack of sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure. Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.</p>
<p>In epileptic seizures a group of neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results in a wave of depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This is due in part to the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.</p>
<p>Focal seizures begin in one hemisphere of the brain while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres. Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have little effect. Gliosis, neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific areas of the brain are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of epilepsy is typically made based on observation of the seizure onset and the underlying cause. An electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging (CT scan or MRI) to look at the structure of the brain are also usually part of the workup. While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted, it is not always possible. Video and EEG monitoring may be useful in difficult cases.</p>

<div id="mental-disorders" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> Mental Disorders</h2>
<p>A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders. Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional.</p>
<p>The causes of mental disorders are often unclear. Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a social context. A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health. Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms, should be taken into account when making a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses and clinical social workers, using various methods such as psychometric tests but often relying on observation and questioning. Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options. Other treatments include lifestyle changes, social interventions, peer support, and self-help. In a minority of cases, there might be involuntary detention or treatment. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression.</p>
<p>Common mental disorders include depression, which affects about 264 million, bipolar disorder, which affects about 45 million, dementia, which affects about 50 million, and schizophrenia and other psychoses, which affects about 20 million people globally. Developmental disorders include intellectual disability and pervasive developmental disorders which usually arise in infancy or childhood. Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.1</span> Mood Disorders</h3>
<p>Mood disorder, also known as mood affective disorders, is a group of conditions where a disturbance in the person’s mood is the main underlying feature. The classification is in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD).</p>
<p>Mood disorders fall into the basic groups of elevated mood, such as mania or hypomania; depressed mood, of which the best-known and most researched is major depressive disorder (MDD) (commonly called clinical depression, unipolar depression, or major depression); and moods which cycle between mania and depression, known as bipolar disorder (BD) (formerly known as manic depression). There are several sub-types of depressive disorders or psychiatric syndromes featuring less severe symptoms such as dysthymic disorder (similar to but milder than MDD) and cyclothymic disorder (similar to but milder than BD).[page needed] Mood disorders may also be substance induced or occur in response to a medical condition.</p>
<p>English psychiatrist Henry Maudsley proposed an overarching category of affective disorder. The term was then replaced by mood-disorder, as the latter term refers to the underlying or longitudinal emotional state, whereas the former refers to the external expression observed by others.</p>
<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD), commonly called major depression, unipolar depression, or clinical depression, wherein a person has one or more major depressive episodes. After a single episode, Major Depressive Disorder (single episode) would be diagnosed. After more than one episode, the diagnosis becomes Major Depressive Disorder (Recurrent). Depression without periods of mania is sometimes referred to as unipolar depression because the mood remains at the bottom “pole” and does not climb to the higher, manic “pole” as in bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Individuals with a major depressive episode or major depressive disorder are at increased risk for suicide. Seeking help and treatment from a health professional dramatically reduces the individual’s risk for suicide. Studies have demonstrated that asking if a depressed friend or family member has thought of committing suicide is an effective way of identifying those at risk, and it does not “plant” the idea or increase an individual’s risk for suicide in any way. Epidemiological studies carried out in Europe suggest that, at this moment, roughly 8.5 percent of the world’s population have a depressive disorder. No age group seems to be exempt from depression, and studies have found that depression appears in infants as young as 6 months old who have been separated from their mothers.</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder (BD) (also called “manic depression” or “manic-depressive disorder”), an unstable emotional condition characterized by cycles of abnormal, persistent high mood (mania) and low mood (depression), which was formerly known as “manic depression” (and in some cases rapid cycling, mixed states, and psychotic symptoms).
It is estimated that roughly 1% of the adult population has bipolar I, a further 1% has bipolar II or cyclothymia, and somewhere between 2% and 5% percent have “sub-threshold” forms of bipolar disorder. Furthermore, the possibility of getting bipolar disorder when one parent is diagnosed with it is 15–30%. Risk, when both parents have it, is 50–75%. Also, while with bipolar siblings the risk is 15–25%, with identical twins it is about 70%.
A minority of people with bipolar disorder have high creativity, artistry or a particular gifted talent. Before the mania phase becomes too extreme, its energy, ambition, enthusiasm and grandiosity often bring people with this type of mood disorder life’s masterpieces.</p>
</div>
<div id="schizophrenia" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.2</span> Schizophrenia</h3>
<p>Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (typically hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person’s reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person. To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, symptoms and functional impairment need to be present for six months (DSM-5) or one month (ICD-11). Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders that often includes an anxiety disorder such as panic disorder, an obsessive–compulsive disorder, or a substance use disorder.</p>
<p>About 0.3% to 0.7% of people are affected by schizophrenia during their lifetime. In 2017, there were an estimated 1.1 million new cases and in 2019 a total of 20 million cases globally. Males are more often affected and on average have an earlier onset. The causes of schizophrenia include genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants. Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, infections, the ages of a person’s mother or father, and poor nutrition during pregnancy.</p>
<p>About half of those diagnosed with schizophrenia will have a significant improvement over the long term with no further relapses, and a small proportion of these will recover completely. The other half will have a lifelong impairment, and severe cases may be repeatedly admitted to hospital. Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation, and victimization are common consequences of schizophrenia. Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia have a higher suicide rate (about 5% overall) and more physical health problems, leading to an average decreased life expectancy of 20 years. In 2015, an estimated 17,000 deaths were caused by schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, job training, and social rehabilitation. Up to a third of people do not respond to initial antipsychotics, in which case the antipsychotic clozapine may be used. In situations where there is a risk of harm to self or others, a short involuntary hospitalization may be necessary. Long-term hospitalization may be needed for a small number of people with severe schizophrenia. In countries where supportive services are limited or unavailable, long-term hospital stays are more typical.</p>
<p>Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior. Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses, and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).</p>
<p>Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia. They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations most commonly involve the sense of hearing as hearing voices but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell, and touch. They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one’s thoughts or feelings are not really one’s own, to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one’s mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common. Thought disorders can include thought blocking, and disorganized speech – speech that is not understandable is known as word salad. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication, and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps related to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.</p>
<p>Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognised domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy. Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing. Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine. It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression. Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt effect, and alogia. Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal. Apathy accounts for around 50 per cent of the most often found negative symptoms and affects functional outcome and subsequent quality of life. Apathy is related to disrupted cognitive processing affecting memory and planning including goal-directed behaviour. The two subdomains has suggested a need for separate treatment approaches. A lack of distress – relating to a reduced experience of depression and anxiety is another noted negative symptom. A distinction is often made between those negative symptoms that are inherent to schizophrenia, termed primary; and those that result from positive symptoms, from the side effects of antipsychotics, substance abuse, and social deprivation - termed secondary negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are less responsive to medication and the most difficult to treat. However if properly assessed, secondary negative symptoms are amenable to treatment.</p>
<p>Scales for specifically assessing the presence of negative symptoms, and for measuring their severity, and their changes have been introduced since the earlier scales such as the PANNS that deals with all types of symptoms. These scales are the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), and the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) also known as second-generation scales. In 2020, ten years after its introduction a cross-cultural study of the use of BNSS found valid and reliable psychometric evidence for the five-domain structure cross-culturally. The BNSS is designed to assess both the presence and severity and change of negative symptoms of the five recognised domains, and the additional item of reduced normal distress. BNSS can register changes in negative symptoms in relation to psychosocial and pharmacological intervention trials. BNSS has also been used to study a proposed non-D2 treatment called SEP-363856. Findings supported the favouring of five domains over the two-dimensional proposition.</p>
<p>Cognitive deficits are the earliest and most constantly found symptoms in schizophrenia. They are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in early adolescence, or childhood. They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms. However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms. Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.</p>
<p>The deficits in cognition are seen to drive the negative psychosocial outcome in schizophrenia, and are claimed to equate to a possible reduction in IQ from the norm of 100 to 70–85. Cognitive deficits may be of neurocognition (nonsocial) or of social cognition. Neurocognition is the ability to receive and remember information, and includes verbal fluency, memory, reasoning, problem solving, speed of processing, and auditory and visual perception. Verbal memory and attention are seen to be the most affected. Verbal memory impairment is associated with a decreased level of semantic processing (relating meaning to words). Another memory impairment is that of episodic memory. An impairment in visual perception that is consistently found in schizophrenia is that of visual backward masking. Visual processing impairments include an inability to perceive complex visual illusions. Social cognition is concerned with the mental operations needed to interpret, and understand the self and others in the social world. This is also an associated impairment, and facial emotion perception is often found to be difficult. Facial perception is critical for ordinary social interaction. Cognitive impairments do not usually respond to antipsychotics, and there are a number of interventions that are used to try to improve them; cognitive remediation therapy has been found to be of particular help.</p>
<p>Onset typically occurs between the late teens and early 30s, with the peak incidence occurring in males in the early to mid twenties, and in females in the late twenties. Onset before the age of 17 is known as early-onset, and before the age of 13, as can sometimes occur is known as childhood schizophrenia or very early-onset. A later stage of onset can occur between the ages of 40 and 60, known as late-onset schizophrenia. A later onset over the age of 60 which may be difficult to differentiate as schizophrenia, is known as very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. Late onset has shown that a higher rate of females are affected; they have less severe symptoms, and need lower doses of antipsychotics. The earlier favouring of onset in males is later seen to be balanced by a post-menopausal increase in the development in females. Estrogen produced pre-menopause, has a dampening effect on dopamine receptors but its protection can be overridden by a genetic overload. There has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of older adults with schizophrenia. An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early onset, and late-onset illness.</p>
<p>Onset may happen suddenly, or may occur after the slow and gradual development of a number of signs and symptoms in a period known as the prodromal stage. Up to 75% of those with schizophrenia go through a prodromal stage. The negative and cognitive symptoms in the prodrome can precede FEP by many months, and up to five years. The period from FEP and treatment is known as the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) which is seen to be a factor in functional outcome. The prodromal stage is the high-risk stage for the development of psychosis. Since the progression to first episode psychosis, is not inevitable an alternative term is often preferred of at risk mental state" Cognitive dysfunction at an early age impacts on a young person’s ususal cognitive development. Recognition and early intervention at the prodromal stage would minimize the associated disruption to educational and social development, and has been the focus of many studies. It is suggested that the use of anti-inflammatory compounds such as D-serine may prevent the transition to schizophrenia. Cognitive symptoms are not secondary to positive symptoms, or to the side effects of antipsychotics.</p>
<p>Cognitive impairments in the prodromal stage become worse after first episode psychosis (after which they return to baseline and then remain fairly stable), making early intervention to prevent such transition of prime importance. Early treatment with cognitive behavioral therapies are the gold standard. Neurological soft signs of clumsiness and loss of fine motor movement are often found in schizophrenia, and these resolve with effective treatment of FEP.</p>
<p>Genetic, environmental, and vulnerability factors are involved in the development of schizophrenia. The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved. A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder that lacks a precise boundary in its definition.</p>

<div id="anatomical-terms-of-location" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Anatomical Terms Of Location</h1>
<p>All vertebrates (including humans) have the same basic body plan – they are strictly bilaterally symmetrical in early embryonic stages and largely bilaterally symmetrical in adulthood. That is, they have mirror-image left and right halves if divided down the middle. For these reasons, the basic directional terms can be considered to be those used in vertebrates. By extension, the same terms are used for many other (invertebrate) organisms as well.</p>
<p>Standardized anatomical and zoological terms of location have been developed, usually based on Latin and Greek words, to enable all biological and medical scientists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal bodies and their component organs, even though the meaning of some of the terms often is context-sensitive.</p>
<p>The vertebrates and Craniata share a substantial heritage and common structure, so many of the same terms are used for location. To avoid ambiguities this terminology is based on the anatomy of each animal in a standard way.</p>
<p>While these terms are standardized within specific fields of biology, there are unavoidable, sometimes dramatic differences between some disciplines. For example, differences in terminology remain a problem that, to some extent, still separates the terminology of human anatomy from that used in the study of various other zoological categories.</p>
<p>For humans, one type of vertebrate, anatomical terms may differ from other forms of vertebrates. For one reason, this is because humans have a different neuraxis and, unlike animals that rest on four limbs, humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position. Thus what is on “top” of a human is the head, whereas the “top” of a dog may be its back, and the “top” of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side.</p>
<div id="anatomical-planes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Anatomical Planes</h2>
<p>Anatomical planes</p>
<ul>
<li>A transverse plane, also known as a cross-section, divides the body into cranial and caudal (head and tail) portions.</li>
<li>A longitudinal plane is any plane that is perpendicular to the transverse plane. The main longitudinal planes are:
<ul>
<li>The frontal plane or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or posterior and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans a coronal plane is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical.</li>
<li>The sagittal plane is a plane parallel to the sagittal suture. All other sagittal planes (referred to as parasagittal planes) are parallel to it. The plane is a Y-Z plane, perpendicular to the ground. A special sagittal plane is the median plane or midsagittal plane in the midline of the body, and divides the body into left and right (sinister and dexter) portions. This passes through the head, spinal cord, navel, and, in many animals, the tail. The term “median plane” can also refer to the midsagittal plane of other structures, such as a digit.</li>

<div id="anatomical-axes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Anatomical Axes</h2>
<p>To begin with, distinct, polar-opposite ends of the organism are chosen. By definition, each pair of opposite points defines an axis. In a bilaterally symmetrical organism, there are 6 polar opposite points, giving three axes that intersect at right angles – the x, y, and z axes familiar from three-dimensional geometry.</p>

<p>The terms “intermediate”, “ipsilateral”, “contralateral”, “superficial”, and “deep”, while indicating directions, are relative terms and thus do not properly define fixed anatomical axes. Also, while the “rostrocaudal” and anteroposterior directionality are equivalent in a significant portion of the human body, they are different directions in other parts of the body.</p>
</div>
<div id="main-anatomical-terms" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Main Anatomical Terms</h2>
<div id="superior-and-inferior" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Superior And Inferior</h3>
<p>In anatomical terminology superior (from Latin, meaning ‘above’) is used to refer to what is above something, and inferior (from Latin, meaning ‘below’) to what is below it. For example, in the anatomical position the most superior part of the human body is the head, and the most inferior is the feet. As a second example, in humans the neck is superior to the chest but inferior to the head.</p>
</div>
<div id="anterior-and-posterior" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Anterior And Posterior</h3>
<p>Anterior refers to what is in front (from Latin ante, meaning “before”) and posterior, what is to the back of the subject (from Latin post, meaning “after”). For example, in a dog the nose is anterior to the eyes and the tail is considered the most posterior part; in many fish the gill openings are posterior to the eyes, but anterior to the tail. In projectional radiography terminology, an anteroposterior (AP) projection is taken with the X-ray generator anteriorly (such as in the front of a human), and the X-ray detector posteriorly. In contrast, a posteroanterior (PA) projection is taken with the X-ray generator posteriorly.</p>
</div>
<div id="medial-and-lateral" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Medial And Lateral</h3>
<p>Lateral (from Latin lateralis, meaning ‘to the side’) refers to the sides of an animal, as in “left lateral” and “right lateral”. The term medial (from Latin medius, meaning ‘middle’) is used to refer to structures close to the centre of an organism, called the “median plane”. For example, in a human, imagine a line down the center of the body from the head though the navel and going between the legs— the medial side of the foot would be the big toe side; the medial side of the knee would be the side adjacent to the other knee. To describe the sides of the knees touching each other would be “right medial” and “left medial”.</p>
<p>The terms “left” and “right” are sometimes used, or their Latin alternatives (Latin: dexter; “right”, Latin: sinister; “left”). However, as left and right sides are mirror images, using these words is somewhat confusing, as structures are duplicated on both sides. For example, it is very confusing to say the dorsal fin of a dolphin is “right of” the left pectoral fin, but is “left of” the right eye, but much easier and clearer to say “the dorsal fin is medial to the pectoral fins”.</p>
<p>Terms derived from lateral include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contralateral (from Latin contra, meaning ‘against’): on the side opposite to another structure. For example, the right arm and leg are represented by the left, i.e., contralateral side of the forebrain.</li>
<li>Ipsilateral (from Latin ipse, meaning ‘same’): on the same side as another structure. For example, the left arm is ipsilateral to the left leg.</li>
<li>Bilateral (from Latin bis, meaning ‘twice’): on both sides of the body. For example, bilateral orchiectomy (removal of testes on both sides of the body’s axis) is surgical castration.</li>
<li>Unilateral (from Latin unus, meaning ‘one’): on one side of the body. For example, unilateral paresis is hemiparesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terms derived from medial include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inferomedial (from Latin inferus, meaning ‘lower’): lower and in or near the midline. For example, the human nose is inferomedial to the eyes.</li>
<li>Superomedial (from Latin superus, meaning ‘above’): above and toward the midline. For example, the human nose is superomedial to the mouth.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="central-and-peripheral" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.4</span> Central And Peripheral</h3>
<p>Central and peripheral are terms that are closely related to concepts such as proximal and distal, but they are so widely applicable that in many respects their flexibility makes them hard to define. Loosely speaking, they distinguish near and far, inside and out, or even organs of vital importance such as heart and lungs, from peripheral organs such as fingers, that undoubtedly may be important, but which it may not be life-threatening to dispense with. Examples of the application of the terms are the distinction between central- and peripheral nervous systems, and between peripheral blood vessels and the central circulatory organs, such as the heart and major vessels. The terms also can apply to large and complex molecules such as proteins, where central amino acid residues are protected from antibodies or the like, but peripheral residues are important in docking and other interactions. Other examples include Central and peripheral circadian clocks, and central versus peripheral vision.</p>
</div>
<div id="superficial-and-deep" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.5</span> Superficial And Deep</h3>
<p>These two terms relate to the distance of a structure from the surface of an animal.</p>
<p>Deep (from Old English) refers to something further away from the surface of the organism. For example, the external oblique muscle of the abdomen is deep to the skin. “Deep” is one of the few anatomical terms of location derived from Old English rather than Latin – the anglicised Latin term would have been “profound” (from Latin profundus, meaning ‘due to depth’).</p>
<p>Superficial (from Latin superficies, meaning ‘surface’) refers to something near the outer surface of the organism. For example, in skin the epidermis is superficial to the subcutis.</p>
</div>
<div id="dorsal-and-ventral" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.6</span> Dorsal And Ventral</h3>
<p>These two terms, used in anatomy and embryology, refer to back (dorsal) and front or belly (ventral) of an organism.</p>
<p>The dorsal (from Latin dorsum, meaning ‘back’) surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side, of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top.</p>
<p>The ventral (from Latin venter, meaning ‘belly’) surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism.</p>
<p>For example, in a fish the pectoral fins are dorsal to the anal fin, but ventral to the dorsal fin.</p>

<p>Specific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal. To describe how close to the head of an animal something is, three distinct terms are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rostral (from Latin rostrum, meaning ‘beak, nose’), meaning situated toward the oral or nasal region, or in the case of the brain, toward the tip of the frontal lobe.</li>
<li>Cranial (from Greek κρανίον, meaning ‘skull’) or cephalic (from Greek κεφαλή, meaning ‘head’).</li>
<li>Caudal (from Latin cauda, meaning ‘tail’) is used to describe how close something is to the trailing end of an organism,
For example, in the horse, the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head.</li>

<p>These terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine. In humans, “cranial” and “cephalic” are used to refer to the skull, with “cranial” being used more commonly. The term “rostral” is rarely used in human anatomy, apart from embryology, and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism. Similarly, the term “caudal” is only occasionally used in human anatomy. This is because the brain is situated at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is situated in the anterior part. Thus the “rostrocaudal axis” refers to a C shape (see image).</p>
<p>The location of anatomical structures can also be described with relation to different anatomical landmarks.</p>
<p>Structures may be described as being at the level of a specific spinal vertebra, depending on the section of the vertebral column the structure is at. The position is often abbreviated. For example, structures at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra may be abbreviated as “C4”, at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra “T4”, and at the level of the third lumbar vertebra “L3”. Because the sacrum and coccyx are fused, they are not often used to provide location.</p>
<p>Directional and locational prefixes can modify many anatomical and morphological terms, sometimes in formally standard usage, but often attached arbitrarily according to need or convenience.</p>
<p>Several other terms are also used to describe location. These terms are not used to form the fixed axes. Terms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Axial (from Latin axis, meaning ‘axle’): around the central axis of the organism or the extremity. Two related terms, “abaxial” and “adaxial”, refer to locations away from and toward the central axis of an organism, respectively</li>
<li>Parietal (from Latin paries, meaning ‘wall’): pertaining to the wall of a body cavity. For example, the parietal peritoneum is the lining on the inside of the abdominal cavity. Parietal can also refer specifically to the parietal bone of the skull or associated structures.</li>
<li>Posteromedial (from Latin posterus, meaning ‘coming after’, and medius, meaning ‘middle’): situated towards the middle of the posterior surface.</li>
<li>Posterosuperior (from Latin posterus, meaning ‘coming after’ and superior): situated towards the upper part of the posterior surface.</li>
<li>Terminal (from Latin terminus, meaning ‘boundary or end’) at the extremity of a (usually projecting) structure, as in “…an antenna with a terminal sensory hair”.</li>
<li>Visceral and viscus (from Latin viscera, meaning ‘internal organs’): associated with organs within the body’s cavities. For example, the stomach is covered with a lining called the visceral peritoneum as opposed to the parietal peritoneum. Viscus can also be used to mean “organ”. For example, the stomach is a viscus within the abdominal cavity.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Prefixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sub- (from Latin sub, meaning ‘preposition beneath, close to, nearly etc’) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, qualifies terms in various senses. Consider subcutaneous as meaning beneath the skin, subterminal meaning near to the end of a structure. Sub- also may mean “nearly” or “more-or-less”; for instance subglobular means almost globular. In many usages sub- is similar in application to “hypo-”</li>
<li>Hypo- (from Ancient Greek ὑπό, meaning ‘under’) Like “sub” in various senses as in hypolingual nerve beneath the tongue, or hypodermal fat beneath the skin</li>
<li>Infra- (from Latin infra, meaning ‘preposition beneath, below etc’) Similar to “sub”; a direct opposite to super- and supra-, as in Infratemporal space or infraorbital.</li>
<li>Inter- (from Latin inter, meaning ‘between’): between two other structures. For example, the navel is intermediate to the left arm and the contralateral (right) leg. The intercostal muscles run between the ribs.</li>
<li>Super- or Supra- (from Latin super, supra, meaning ‘above, on top of, beyond etc’) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, as in superciliary arches or supraorbital</li>

<div id="nucleus" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Nucleus</h2>
<p>In neuroanatomy, a nucleus (plural form: nuclei) is a cluster of neurons in the central nervous system, located deep within the cerebral hemispheres and brainstem. The neurons in one nucleus usually have roughly similar connections and functions. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts, the bundles (fascicles) of axons (nerve fibers) extending from the cell bodies. A nucleus is one of the two most common forms of nerve cell organization, the other being layered structures such as the cerebral cortex or cerebellar cortex. In anatomical sections, a nucleus shows up as a region of gray matter, often bordered by white matter. The vertebrate brain contains hundreds of distinguishable nuclei, varying widely in shape and size. A nucleus may itself have a complex internal structure, with multiple types of neurons arranged in clumps (subnuclei) or layers.</p>
<p>The term “nucleus” is in some cases used rather loosely, to mean simply an identifiably distinct group of neurons, even if they are spread over an extended area. The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, for example, is a thin layer of inhibitory neurons that surrounds the thalamus.</p>
<p>Some of the major anatomical components of the brain are organized as clusters of interconnected nuclei. Notable among these are the thalamus and hypothalamus, each of which contains several dozen distinguishable substructures. The medulla and pons also contain numerous small nuclei with a wide variety of sensory, motor, and regulatory functions.</p>
<p>In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), a cluster of cell bodies of neurons (homologous to a CNS nucleus) is called a ganglion. The fascicles of nerve fibers in the PNS (homologous to CNS tracts) are called nerves.</p>
</div>
<div id="ganglion" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Ganglion</h2>
<p>A ganglion is a group of neuron cell bodies in the peripheral nervous system. In the somatic nervous system this includes dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia among a few others. In the autonomic nervous system there are both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia which contain the cell bodies of postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons respectively.</p>
<p>Ganglia are primarily made up of somata and dendritic structures which are bundled or connected. Ganglia often interconnect with other ganglia to form a complex system of ganglia known as a plexus. Ganglia provide relay points and intermediary connections between different neurological structures in the body, such as the peripheral and central nervous systems.</p>
<p>Among vertebrates there are three major groups of ganglia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dorsal root ganglia (also known as the spinal ganglia) contain the cell bodies of sensory (afferent) neurons.</li>
<li>Cranial nerve ganglia contain the cell bodies of cranial nerve neurons.</li>
<li>Autonomic ganglia contain the cell bodies of autonomic nerves.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the autonomic nervous system, fibers from the central nervous system to the ganglia are known as preganglionic fibers, while those from the ganglia to the effector organ are called postganglionic fibers.</p>
<p>Basal ganglia
The term “ganglion” refers to the peripheral nervous system.</p>
<p>However, in the brain (part of the central nervous system), the “basal ganglia” is a group of nuclei interconnected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, associated with a variety of functions: motor control, cognition, emotions, and learning.</p>
<p>Partly due to this ambiguity, the Terminologia Anatomica recommends using the term basal nuclei instead of basal ganglia; however, this usage has not been generally adopted.</p>
</div>
<div id="tract" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Tract</h2>
<p>A nerve tract is a bundle of nerve fibers (axons) connecting nuclei of the central nervous system. In the peripheral nervous system this is known as a nerve, and has associated connective tissue. The main nerve tracts in the central nervous system are of three types: association fibers, commissural fibers, and projection fibers. A tract may also be referred to as a commissure, fasciculus or decussation. A commissure connects the two cerebral hemispheres at the same levels. Examples are the posterior commissure and the corpus callosum. A decussation is a connection made by fibres that cross at different levels (obliquely), such as the sensory decussation. Examples of a fascicle are the subthalamic fasciculus and the lenticular fasciculus.</p>
<p>In the brain, bundles of axons are also categorized by their function into association fibers, projection fibers, and commissural fibers.</p>
</div>
<div id="lemniscus" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Lemniscus</h2>
<p>A lemniscus (Greek for ribbon or band) is a bundle of secondary sensory fibres in the brainstem. The medial lemniscus and lateral lemniscus terminate in specific relay nuclei of the diencephalon. The trigeminal lemniscus is sometimes considered as the cephalic part of the medial lemniscus.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Brodmann Areas</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area">Brodmann area</a> is a region of the cerebral cortex, in the human or other primate brain, defined by its cytoarchitecture, or histological structure and organization of cells.</p>
<p>Brodmann areas were originally defined and numbered by the German anatomist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korbinian_Brodmann">Korbinian Brodmann</a> based on the cytoarchitectural organization of neurons he observed in the cerebral cortex using the Nissl method of cell staining. Brodmann published his maps of cortical areas in humans, monkeys, and other species in 1909, along with many other findings and observations regarding the general cell types and laminar organization of the mammalian cortex.</p>
<p>Brodmann areas have been discussed, debated, refined, and renamed exhaustively for nearly a century and remain the most widely known and frequently cited cytoarchitectural organization of the human cortex.</p>
<p>Many of the areas Brodmann defined based solely on their neuronal organization have since been correlated closely to diverse cortical functions. For example, Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2 are the primary somatosensory cortex; area 4 is the primary motor cortex; area 17 is the primary visual cortex; and areas 41 and 42 correspond closely to primary auditory cortex. Higher order functions of the association cortical areas are also consistently localized to the same Brodmann areas by neurophysiological, functional imaging, and other methods (e.g., the consistent localization of Broca’s speech and language area to the left Brodmann areas 44 and 45). However, functional imaging can only identify the approximate localization of brain activations in terms of Brodmann areas since their actual boundaries in any individual brain requires its histological examination.</p>
